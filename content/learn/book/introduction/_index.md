</h2>

A bevy is a group of birds!

But Bevy is also a modular game engine built in Rust, with a focus on developer productivity and performance.

It has the following design goals:
* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm 
* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like
* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun

Bevy is [built in the open by volunteers](/learn/book/contributing) using the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust programming language</a>. The code is free and open-source because we believe developers should fully own their tools. Games are a huge part of our culture and humanity is investing _millions_ of hours into the development of games. Why are we continuing to build up the ecosystems of closed-source monopolies that take cuts of our sales and deny us visibility into the tech we use daily? We believe that the developer community can do so much better.

    Stability Warning
</h2>

Bevy aims to be a general purpose game engine capable of handling any 2D or 3D workload. However Bevy is still in its infancy. <span class="warning">We are currently in the <i>prototyping</i> phase: important features are missing and APIs will change constantly.</span> If you are currently trying to pick an engine for your Next Big Projectâ„¢, we recommend that you check out <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. It is currently much more feature-complete and stable. And it is also free, open-source, and <a href="https://github.com/GodotNativeTools/godot-rust" target="_blank">scriptable with Rust!</a>

Phew! If you haven't been scared away yet, lets move on to learning some Bevy!
